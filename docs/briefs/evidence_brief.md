# Evidence Brief — Demo Study in Hypertension

**Indication:** Hypertension  
**Population:** Adults 40–80 years with stage 1–2 hypertension  
**Intervention:** Drug X (once daily)  
**Comparator:** Placebo  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Prepared by:** Maria Camila Cuesta

## Key Messages
- Drug X shows improved outcomes over placebo in the simulated cohort.
- Effect magnitude should be confirmed in real-world or clinical trial data.
