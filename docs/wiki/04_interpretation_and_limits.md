# Interpretation & Limits

- **Effect sizes** (RD/RR/OR) summarize differences between arms; interpretation must consider study design and clinical plausibility.  
- **Confidence intervals** represent uncertainty; wide CIs or intervals crossing null (0 for RD, 1 for RR/OR) suggest inconclusive evidence.  
- **Synthetic inputs** cannot capture the full complexity of real-world studies (e.g., missingness, protocol deviations, multiplicity).  
- This tool supports **rapid scientific communication**, not causal inference.
